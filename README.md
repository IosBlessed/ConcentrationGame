# This is the game-application which perform you to train your attentional skills

# For better experience, please, follow next steps: 
    ## Try to avoid any mistakes related to doublicates of internal files such as Info.plist and etc. (Project -> Build Phases -> Copy Bundle Resources -> Delete Info.plist or any repeating files)
    ## After you fill pull this project into your local repository, please, check the Architecture settings inside project settings (You may ignore whole iOS Simulators with arch arm64 => please, be sure, that you didn't ignore them)
    ## Inside this project I used Firebase as Database and UIKit, as main Framework and CocoaPods as a dependency manager. 

# This is an MVP -> I'll upgrade asap, now, KINDLY ask you to test it only via iPhone 11 simulator.
